# RentalListing

The goal of this task is to try to predict the interest level of an apartment rental listing based on different variables such as number of bedrooms, price, location, and more. The interest level in this dataset is the number of inquiries a listing has in the duration that the listing was live on the rental site. It is important to note that this is a classification task; the target variable is categorical with 3 different categories of low, medium and high. We also want to maximize accuracy for this task.
