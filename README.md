The goal of this task is to try to predict the interest level of an apartment rental listing based on different variables such as number of bedrooms, price, location, and more. The interest level in this dataset is the number of inquiries a listing has in the duration that the listing was live on the rental site. It is important to note that this is a classification task; the target variable is categorical with 3 different categories of low, medium and high. We also want to maximize accuracy for this task.

PCA analysis to understand feature importance was conducted along with the ML models of logistic regression, random forests and XGboost to try to predict the level of interest a property would receive. The average of the random forest results along with the XGboost results obtained the best score on Kaggle.
